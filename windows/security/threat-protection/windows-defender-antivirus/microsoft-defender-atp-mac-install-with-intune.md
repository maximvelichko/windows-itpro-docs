# Microsoft Intune-based deployment

**Applies to:**

[Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP) for Mac](microsoft-defender-atp-mac.md)

>[!IMPORTANT]
>This topic relates to the pre-release version of Microsoft Defender ATP for Mac. Microsoft Defender ATP for Mac is not yet widely available, and this topic only applies to enterprise customers who have been accepted into the preview program. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.

## Prerequisites and system requirements

Before you get started, please see [the main Microsoft Defender ATP for Mac page](microsoft-defender-atp-mac.md) for a description of prerequisites and system requirements for the current software version.

## Download installation and onboarding packages

Download the installation and onboarding packages from Microsoft Defender Security Center:

1. In Microsoft Defender Security Center, go to **Settings** > **Device Management** > **Onboarding**.
2. In Section 1 of the page, set the operating system to **Linux, macOS, iOS or Android** and the deployment method to **Mobile Device Management / Microsoft Intune**.
3. In Section 2 of the page, select **Download installation package**. Save it as _wdav.pkg_ to a local directory.
4. In Section 2 of the page, select **Download onboarding package**. Save it as _WindowsDefenderATPOnboardingPackage.zip_ to the same directory.
5. Download **IntuneAppUtil** from [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/lob-apps-macos](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/lob-apps-macos).

6. From a command prompt, verify that you have the three files.
    Extract the contents of the .zip files:

    ```bash
    mavel-macmini:Downloads test$ ls -l
    total 721688
    -rw-r--r--  1 test  staff     269280 Mar 15 11:25 IntuneAppUtil
    -rw-r--r--  1 test  staff      11821 Mar 15 09:23 WindowsDefenderATPOnboardingPackage.zip
    -rw-r--r--  1 test  staff  354531845 Mar 13 08:57 wdav.pkg
    mavel-macmini:Downloads test$ unzip WindowsDefenderATPOnboardingPackage.zip
    Archive:  WindowsDefenderATPOnboardingPackage.zip
    warning:  WindowsDefenderATPOnboardingPackage.zip appears to use backslashes as path separators
      inflating: intune/kext.xml
      inflating: intune/WindowsDefenderATPOnboarding.xml
      inflating: jamf/WindowsDefenderATPOnboarding.plist
    mavel-macmini:Downloads test$
    ```

7. Make IntuneAppUtil an executable:

    ```mavel-macmini:Downloads test$ chmod +x IntuneAppUtil```

8. Create the wdav.pkg.intunemac package from wdav.pkg:

    ```bash
    mavel-macmini:Downloads test$ ./IntuneAppUtil -c wdav.pkg -o . -i "com.microsoft.wdav" -n "1.0.0"
    Microsoft Intune Application Utility for Mac OS X
    Version: 1.0.0.0

    Creating intunemac file for /Users/test/Downloads/wdav.pkg
    Composing the intunemac file output
    Output written to ./wdav.pkg.intunemac.

    IntuneAppUtil successfully processed "wdav.pkg",
    to deploy refer to the product documentation.
    ```

## Client device setup

You need no special provisioning for a Mac device beyond a standard [Company Portal installation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/intune-user-help/enroll-your-device-in-intune-macos-cp).

1. You'll be asked to confirm device management.

![Confirm device management screenshot](images/MDATP_3_ConfirmDeviceMgmt.png)

Select **Open System Preferences**, locate **Management Profile** on the list and select **Approve...**. Your Management Profile would be displayed as **Verified**:

![Management profile screenshot](images/MDATP_4_ManagementProfile.png)

2. Select **Continue** and complete the enrollment.

You may now enroll additional devices. You can also enroll them later, after you have finished provisioning system configuration and application packages.

3. In Intune, open **Manage** > **Devices** > **All devices**. You'll see your device among those listed:

![Add Devices screenshot](images/MDATP_5_allDevices.png)

## Create System Configuration profiles

1. In Intune, open **Manage** > **Device configuration**. Select **Manage** > **Profiles** > **Create Profile**.
2. Choose a name for the profile. Change **Platform=macOS** to **Profile type=Custom**. Select **Configure**.
3. Open the configuration profile and upload intune/kext.xml. This file was created during the Generate settings step above.
4. Select **OK**.

5. Select **Manage** > **Assignments**. In the **Include** tab, select **Assign to All Users & All devices**.
6. Repeat steps 1 through 5 for additional profiles.
7. Create a new profile one more time, give it a name, and upload the intune/WindowsDefenderATPOnboarding.xml file.
8. Select **Manage > Assignments**.  In the **Include** tab, select **Assign to All Users & All devices**.

Once the Intune changes are propagated to the enrolled devices, you'll see them listed under **Monitor** > **Device status**:

## Publish application

1. In Intune, open the **Manage > Client apps** blade. Select **Apps > Add**.
2. Select **App type=Other/Line-of-business app**.
3. Select **file=wdav.pkg.intunemac**. Select **OK** to upload.
4. Select **Configure** and add the required information.
5. Use **macOS Sierra 10.12** as the minimum OS. Other settings can be any arbitrary value.

6. Select **OK** and **Add**.

7. It may take a few moments to upload the package. After it's done, select the package from the list and go to **Assignments** and **Add group**.

    ![Client apps screenshot](images/MDATP_10_ClientApps.png)

8. Change **Assignment type** to **Required**.
9. Select **Included Groups**. Select **Make this app required for all devices=Yes**. Select **Select group to include** and add a group that contains the users you want to target. Select **OK** and **Save**.

10. After some time the application will be published to all enrolled devices. You'll see it listed on **Monitor** > **Device**, under **Device install status**:

    ![Intune device status screenshot](images/MDATP_12_DeviceInstall.png)

## Verify client device state

1. After the configuration profiles are deployed to your devices, open **System Preferences** > **Profiles** on your Mac device.

    ![System Preferences screenshot](images/MDATP_13_SystemPreferences.png)
    ![System Preferences Profiles screenshot](images/MDATP_14_SystemPreferencesProfiles.png)

2. Verify that the following configuration profiles are present and installed. The **Management Profile** should be the Intune system profile. _Wdav-config_ and _wdav-kext_ are system configuration profiles that we added in Intune.:

3. You should also see the Microsoft Defender icon in the top-right corner:
